PERSONAL PROJECTS:

Quordle- A twist to the NYT's "Wordle", "Quordle" makes the user solve four words 
at once. With feedback of guess results from the user, this program will produce the
best guesses to solve the Quordle.

Sol- By far my largest program, Sol is an entire game-scoring interface for one of my
favorite games, Multitaire. The game involves multiple players, each with their own decks, playing solitaire with a communal foundations. A player's score is represented
by (player's cards remaining) - (average cards remaining of all players in game). I call this 
adjusted player score their "Par" score.

Program Features:
-Computer generated round schedule for up to 100 players, with games of 2-7 players. In cases
of remainders, e.g. 3 players with 2 per game, each player will sit out as close to an even amount of times as possible.
-Scoreboard interface with standings, pars, un-adjusted scores, and round schedule
-5 save files
-User friendly input prompts
